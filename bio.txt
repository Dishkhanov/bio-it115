Hello, my name is Daniel Ishkhanov, I’m currently a 21 year old student in the Yearup program at Seattle Central College completing the Systems Development & Technology path.
I have a vision for the future to build my own brand and community that helps people grow as an individual and as well as share each other’s knowledge.
My leadership mentality has helped me get to where I currently am and has been able to always look ahead for the benefit of myself and the others around me.
I am ready to apply all my skills to any opportunity that gets presented to me in the near future.
